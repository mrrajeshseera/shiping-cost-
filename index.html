    <p>2.Shipping Cost Based on Weight and Destination

        Problem:
        Write a program that calculates the shipping cost for a parcel based on its weight and destination:
        
        Weight <= 1kg:
        
        Local: 5rs
        
        National: 8rs
        
        International: 15rs
        
        Weight > 1kg and <= 5kg:
        
        Local: 10rs
        
        National: 15rs
        
        International: 30rs
        
        Weight > 5kg and <= 10kg:
        
        Local: 20rs
        
        National: 25rs
        
        International: 50rs
        
        Weight > 10kg:
        
        Local: 30rs
        
        National: 35rs
        
        International: 70rs
        
        
        Requirements:
        
        Input: Two variables for weight and destination
        
        Output: The total shipping cost
        </p>
